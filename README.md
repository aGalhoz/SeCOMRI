# SeCOMRI

## Description

In this repository you can find demo data files and R scripts to reproduce 
* static and spatio-temporal trajectory analyses of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and staff members
* comparison of patient mobility between positive and non-positive COVID-19 patients 

available in the manuscript *Infection Control Measures and Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among 4,554 University Hospital Employees, Munich, Germany*, published in [Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022)](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2803.204436).

## Usage

Demo data trajectories of patients and staff members were created. Similarly, the hospital map used as demo can be found in the [website](https://www.translatum.tum.de/en/contact/). All of these files can be found in the `Data/` folder.  
This project was conducted in [R software](https://www.r-project.org). 
All the necessary R package dependencies are
* dplyr
* ggplot2
* RColorBrewer
* data.table
* png
* reshape2
* rasterVis
* gganimate
* ggthemes
* latticeExtra
* magick
* scales

An adaptation of the original source code is presented with the assumption of prior data processing.
